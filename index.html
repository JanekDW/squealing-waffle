				Both of us have always been drawn to tales of adventure, fights against great enemies, and exploration of the unknown. We're determined to live such tales in our lives. We're going to search for and slay dragons. We're going to find new lands. We're going to meet with kings and queens and write a story after we're all done. So join us if you'd like - we'll be glad for the company.

				Love, Abby and Janek
